/*
Coding Challenge #1

Your tasks:
    1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
       'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
        km/h
    2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
       and log the new speed to the console
    3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
       the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
   'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
*/

// 1
const Car = function (make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
};

// 2
Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 10;
  console.log(`${this.make} is going ${this.speed}km/h`);
};

// 3
Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed -= 5;
  console.log(`${this.make} is going ${this.speed}km/h`);
};

// Cars
const car1 = new Car('BMW', 120);
const car2 = new Car('Mercedes', 95);

// Testing/ experimenting
console.log(car1, car2);
car1.accelerate();
console.log(car1);
car1.brake();
car1.brake();
car1.brake();
console.log(car1);
car2.brake();
car2.accelerate();
console.log(car2);
