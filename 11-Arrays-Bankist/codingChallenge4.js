/*
Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if 
dogs are eating too much or too little. Eating too much means the dog's 
current food portion is larger than the recommended portion, and eating 
too little is the opposite. Eating an okay amount means the dog's current 
food portion is within a range 10% above and 10% below the recommended 
portion (see hint).

Your tasks:

1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate 
   the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. 
   Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array. 
   Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. 
   (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)

2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or 
   too little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to 
   find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose)

3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much 
   ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat 
   too little ('ownersEatTooLittle').

4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3.,like this:
   "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and 
   "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat too little!"

5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount 
   of food that is recommended (just true or false)

6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of 
   food (just true or false)

7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of 
   food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)

8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended 
   food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions 
    are inside the array's objects ðŸ˜‰)

/*
Hints:
- Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the 
  summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰

- Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: 
  current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10). 
  Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the 
  recommended portion.
