Coding Challenge #2

For this challenge you will actually have to watch the video! Then, build the image
loading functionality that I just showed you on the screen.

Your tasks:
Tasks are not super-descriptive this time, so that you can figure out some stuff by
yourself. Pretend you're working on your own 😉

PART 1
1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives 'imgPath' as an input.
   This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use
   document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the
   provided image path

2. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the
   'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the
   image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image (listen for
   the'error' event), reject the promise

3. If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution

PART 2
4. Consume the promise using .then and also add an error handler

5. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the 'wait'
   function we created earlier

6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display CSS
   property to 'none'), and load a second image (Hint: Use the image element
   returned by the 'createImage' promise to hide the current image. You will
   need a global variable for that 😉)

7. After the second image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds again

8. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image

Test data: Images in the img folder. Test the error handler by passing a wrong
image path. Set the network speed to “Fast 3G” in the dev tools Network tab,
otherwise images load too fast

let currentImg;
const imgContainer = document.querySelector('.images');

const wait = function (seconds) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

const createImg = function (imgPath) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = imgPath;
    img.addEventListener('load', function () {
      imgContainer.append(img);
      resolve(img);
    });
    img.addEventListener('error', function () {
      reject(new Error('Failed to load image'));
    });
  });
};

// createImg('img/img-4.jpg');
createImg('img/img-1.jpg')
  .then(img => {
    currentImg = img;
    console.log('Image 1 loaded');
    return wait(2);
  })
  .then(() => {
    currentImg.style.display = 'none';
    return createImg('img/img-2.jpg');
  })
  .then(img => {
    currentImg = img;
    console.log('Image 2 loaded');
    return wait(2);
  })
  .then(() => {
    currentImg.style.display = 'none';
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(`Something went wrong -- ${err.message}`);
  });
